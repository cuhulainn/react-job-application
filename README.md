# Cuhulainn's Submission

This project was created to submit a job application for a front end developer role with an awesome company. I was unable to commit enough time to implement the 'step 1 of 3' and the fixed aspect ratio, but I believe I got everything else. I look forward to the opportunity to continue this process and hopefully join your team, if we both see a good fit!

Here's the mockup I was implementing: https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/K7V8HV6Q9HM#/screens/397486263

## Questions from task sheet

- What would you use to make an app/site pass WAI Test?

  - I would review the w3 guide found here: https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/tools/selecting/ and then filter accompanying list of tools to determine what tools were most appropriate for the project I was working on, based on regions/languages/technologies used.

- Which processes would you use to optimize a React App for speed and performance?

  - Create a minified production build of the app, then utilize the React DevTools Profiler to locate Components that have high load times or are causing too many re-renders, etc. I would also review the code for opportunities to virtualize lists, and remove unneeded updates to state or props that can slow things down.

- What was the most significant project you ever worked on with React? What was your job/role? Describe what tools and app architecture was used on that project. If possible, share a public repo where we can check
  - The most significant project I've worked on to date is a side project for a startup. I'm the lead front end developer, responsible for all the design and functionality of the front end. The app pulls data from relational databases via APIs written in Node/Express all hosted on AWS. The UX requires guiding the user through a series of questions to make a product suggestion. The front end will eventually connect with external API's to fetch data about product availability and eventually allow for online product purchase. I don't have a public repo I can share for it at this time, nor a link as we've not yet publically launched.
